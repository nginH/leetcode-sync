## Problem

You are given an array of non-overlapping intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represent the start and the end of the `i^th` interval and `intervals` is sorted in ascending order by `start_i`. You are also given an interval `newInterval = [start, end]` that represents the start and end of another interval.

Two intervals are considered overlapping if they share **at least** one point.

Insert `newInterval` into `intervals` such that `intervals` is still sorted in ascending order by `start_i` and `intervals` still does not have any overlapping intervals (merge overlapping intervals if necessary).

Return `intervals`* after the insertion*.

**Note** that you don't need to modify `intervals` in-place. You can make a new array and return it.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
**Output:** [[1,5],[6,9]]

Example 2:**

**Input:** intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
**Output:** [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
**Explanation:** Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

 

**Constraints:**

	- `0 <= intervals.length <= 10^4`

	- `intervals[i].length == 2`

	- `0 <= start_i <= end_i <= 10^5`

	- `intervals` is sorted by `start_i` in **ascending** order.

	- `newInterval.length == 2`

	- `0 <= start <= end <= 10^5`

## Sample Test Case

```text
[[1,3],[6,9]]
[2,5]
```

## Hints

1. Intervals Array is sorted. Can you use Binary Search to find the correct position to insert the new Interval.?
2. Can you try merging the overlapping intervals while inserting the new interval?
3. This can be done by comparing the end of the last interval with the start of the new interval and vice versa.
