## Problem

We build a table of `n` rows (**1-indexed**). We start by writing `0` in the `1^st` row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence of `1` with `10`.

	- For example, for `n = 3`, the `1^st` row is `0`, the `2^nd` row is `01`, and the `3^rd` row is `0110`.

Given two integer `n` and `k`, return the `k^th` (**1-indexed**) symbol in the `n^th` row of a table of `n` rows.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** row 1: 0

Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, k = 1
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01

Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 2, k = 2
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 
row 1: 0
row 2: 01

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= n <= 30`

	- `1 <= k <= 2^n - 1`
