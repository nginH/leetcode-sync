## Problem

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,2]
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.

Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,1]
**Output:** 4
**Explanation:** Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3]
**Output:** 3

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`

	- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Sample Test Case

[2,3,2]
```

## Example Test Cases

```text
[2,3,2]
[1,2,3,1]
[1,2,3]
```

## Hints

1. Since House[1] and House[n] are adjacent, they cannot be robbed together. Therefore, the problem becomes to rob either House[1]-House[n-1] or House[2]-House[n], depending on which choice offers more money. Now the problem has degenerated to the <a href ="https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/description/">House Robber</a>, which is already been solved.
