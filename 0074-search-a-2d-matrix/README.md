## Problem

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `matrix` with the following two properties:

	- Each row is sorted in non-decreasing order.

	- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

Given an integer `target`, return `true` *if* `target` *is in* `matrix` *or* `false` *otherwise*.

You must write a solution in `O(log(m * n))` time complexity.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 3
**Output:** true

Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,3,5,7],[10,11,16,20],[23,30,34,60]], target = 13
**Output:** false

 

**Constraints:**

	- `m == matrix.length`

	- `n == matrix[i].length`

	- `1 <= m, n <= 100`

	- `-10^4 <= matrix[i][j], target <= 10^4`
