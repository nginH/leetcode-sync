## Problem

Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

Implement the `MinStack` class:

	- `MinStack()` initializes the stack object.

	- `void push(int value)` pushes the element `value` onto the stack.

	- `void pop()` removes the element on the top of the stack.

	- `int top()` gets the top element of the stack.

	- `int getMin()` retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with `O(1)` time complexity for each function.

 

Example 1:**

**Input**
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]

**Output**
[null,null,null,null,-3,null,0,-2]

**Explanation**
MinStack minStack = new MinStack();
minStack.push(-2);
minStack.push(0);
minStack.push(-3);
minStack.getMin(); // return -3
minStack.pop();
minStack.top();    // return 0
minStack.getMin(); // return -2

 

**Constraints:**

	- `-2^31 <= val <= 2^31 - 1`

	- Methods `pop`, `top` and `getMin` operations will always be called on **non-empty** stacks.

	- At most `3 * 10^4` calls will be made to `push`, `pop`, `top`, and `getMin`.

## Sample Test Case

```text
["MinStack","push","push","push","getMin","pop","top","getMin"]
[[],[-2],[0],[-3],[],[],[],[]]
```

## Hints

1. Consider each node in the stack having a minimum value. (Credits to @aakarshmadhavan)
