## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays of `nums` that meet the following conditions:

	- The length of the subarray is `k`, and

	- All the elements of the subarray are **distinct**.

Return *the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions**.* If no subarray meets the conditions, return `0`.

*A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.*

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
**Output:** 15
**Explanation:** The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
- [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
- [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
- [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
- [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions

Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
- [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Sample Test Case

```text
[1,5,4,2,9,9,9]
3
```

## Hints

1. Which elements change when moving from the subarray of size k that ends at index i to the subarray of size k that ends at index i + 1?
2. Only two elements change, the element at i + 1 is added into the subarray, and the element at i - k + 1 gets removed from the subarray.
3. Iterate through each subarray of size k and keep track of the sum of the subarray and the frequency of each element.
