## Problem

There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `from_i` and `to_i`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`, If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities ***i*** and ***j*** is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4
**Output:** 3
**Explanation: **The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1, City 2] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3] 
City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3] 
City 3 -> [City 1, City 2] 
Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2
**Output:** 0
**Explanation: **The figure above describes the graph. 
The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:
City 0 -> [City 1] 
City 1 -> [City 0, City 4] 
City 2 -> [City 3, City 4] 
City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]
City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3] 
The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `2 <= n <= 100`

	- `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`

	- `edges[i].length == 3`

	- `0 <= from_i < to_i < n`

	- `1 <= weight_i, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`

	- All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.

## Sample Test Case

```text
4
[[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]]
4
```

## Example Test Cases

```text
4
[[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]]
4
5
[[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]
2
```

## Hints

1. Use Floyd-Warshall's algorithm to compute any-point to any-point distances. (Or can also do Dijkstra from every node due to the weights are non-negative).
2. For each city calculate the number of reachable cities within the threshold, then search for the optimal city.
