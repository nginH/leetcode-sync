## Problem

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return *the total number of subarrays whose sum equals to* `k`.

A subarray is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
**Output:** 2
Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
**Output:** 2

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`

	- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

	- `-10^7 <= k <= 10^7`

## Sample Test Case

```text
[1,1,1]
2
```

## Example Test Cases

```text
[1,1,1]
2
[1,2,3]
3
```

## Hints

1. Will Brute force work here? Try to optimize it.
2. Can we optimize it by using some extra space?
3. What about storing sum frequencies in a hash table? Will it be useful?
4. sum(i,j)=sum(0,j)-sum(0,i), where sum(i,j) represents the sum of all the elements from index i to j-1.

Can we use this property to optimize it.
