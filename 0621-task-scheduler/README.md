## Problem

You are given an array of CPU `tasks`, each labeled with a letter from A to Z, and a number `n`. Each CPU interval can be idle or allow the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: there has to be a gap of **at least** `n` intervals between two tasks with the same label.

Return the **minimum** number of CPU intervals required to complete all tasks.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.

After completing task A, you must wait two intervals before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3^rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4^th interval, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.

Example 2:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.

With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.

Example 3:**

**Input:** tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.

There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4`

	- `tasks[i]` is an uppercase English letter.

	- `0 <= n <= 100`

## Sample Test Case

```text
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
2
```

## Example Test Cases

```text
["A","A","A","B","B","B"]
2
["A","C","A","B","D","B"]
1
["A","A","A", "B","B","B"]
3
```

## Hints

1. There are many different solutions for this problem, including a greedy algorithm.
2. For every cycle, find the most frequent letter that can be placed in this cycle. After placing, decrease the frequency of that letter by one.
3. Use Priority Queue.
