## Problem

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true`* if *`s`* is a **subsequence** of *`t`*, or *`false`* otherwise*.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** true
Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
**Output:** false

 

**Constraints:**

	- `0 = 10^9`, and you want to check one by one to see if `t` has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?
