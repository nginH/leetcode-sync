## Problem

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of positive integers and an integer `k`.

The **prime factor set** of a **subarray** is the **union** of the distinct **prime** factors of all its elements.

Return the length of the **longest** subarray whose prime factor set contains **at most** `k` distinct prime factors. If no such subarray exists, return 0.

 

Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [7,6,10,12,11], k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Consider the subarray `[6, 10, 12]`:

	- The distinct prime factors of 6 are `{2, 3}`.

	- The distinct prime factors of 10 are `{2, 5}`.

	- The distinct prime factors of 12 are `{2, 3}`.

	- The union of these sets is `{2, 3, 5}`, which contains 3 distinct prime factors.

No longer subarray satisfies the condition. Therefore, the answer is 3.

Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,6,9,18], k = 4

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

Consider the entire array `[4, 6, 9, 18]`:

	- The distinct prime factors of 4 are `{2}`.

	- The distinct prime factors of 6 are `{2, 3}`.

	- The distinct prime factors of 9 are `{3}`.

	- The distinct prime factors of 18 are `{2, 3}`.

	- The union of these sets is `{2, 3}`, which contains 2 distinct prime factors.

Since `2 Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [6,10,15], k = 2

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

Every subarray of length at least 2 has prime factor set `{2, 3, 5}`, which contains 3 distinct prime factors.

Since `3 > 2`, only subarrays of length 1 are valid. Therefore, the answer is 1.

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

	- `2 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

	- `1 <= k <= 10^4`

## Sample Test Case

```text
[7,6,10,12,11]
3
```

## Example Test Cases

```text
[7,6,10,12,11]
3
[4,6,9,18]
4
[6,10,15]
2
```

## Hints

1. Precompute the distinct prime factors of every value, for example using a smallest-prime-factor sieve.
2. Use a sliding window and maintain how many elements in the current window contain each prime factor. Shrink the window whenever the number of prime factors with a positive frequency exceeds <code>k</code>.
